# Building Diffusion Model from Scratch

Welcome to the "How-Diffusion-Models-Work" repository. This is designed to teach how to construct a diffusion model from the ground up.

## Repository Overview

In this Repository:

- Explore the diffusion-based generative AI and create diffusion model from scratch.
- Gain familiarity with the diffusion process and the models going beyond pre-built models and APIs.
- Codes on sampling, training diffusion models, building neural networks for noise prediction, and adding context for personalized image generation.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the following:

- Lab exercises
- Sample code
